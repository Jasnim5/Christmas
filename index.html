        Christmas is celebrated on December 25 and is both a sacred religious
        holiday and a worldwide cultural and commercial phenomenon. For two
        millennia, people around the world have been observing it with
        traditions and practices that are both religious and secular in nature.
        Christians celebrate Christmas Day as the anniversary of the birth of
        Jesus of Nazareth, a spiritual leader whose teachings form the basis of
        their religion. Popular customs include exchanging gifts, decorating
        Christmas trees, attending church, sharing meals with family and friends
        and, of course, waiting for Santa Claus to arrive. December 25—Christmas
        Day—has been a federal holiday in the United States since 1870.
